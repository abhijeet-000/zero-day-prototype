# ZERO-DAY ATTACK PROTOTYPE 

The files which are attached above are just a prototype of our project zeroday attack detection model.
Firstly to run the backend of the appliction perfectly you need to istall all the modules which are given in the "Requirements.txt".
The backend is designed using fastapi where all our models were deployed.
Coming to the frontend , it is created using react js.(As it is just a prototype , the user interface is not appealing , but changes will be made)
Start the backend server using the command "uvicorn mlapi:app --reload".
Make sure that the port number of your backend server in the ./zeroday/src/App.js if it is other than localhost:8000. (generally, backend servers run on localhost:8000)
